What is Decorators

Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour
of a function or class.But before diving deep into decorators let us understand some concepts that will come in
handy in learning the decorators.

1. Namespace and Variable Scope
 - We use `names` (such as variable name, class name, function name) in python to identify the object just like
   we use name to identify person in real life, so `Namespace` is the system which will control all the names which
   we use in our program, and it will assure the all the names which we use is unique, and it won't lead nay conflict.
   * Types of namespace

    - Built-in namespace
      When you start the python interpreter build-in namespace is created which contain all the build-in names.
      So, when Python interpreter runs solely without any user-defined modules, methods, classes, etc. Some functions
      like print(), id() are always present, these are built-in namespaces.

    - Global namespace
      When a user creates a module, a global namespace gets created, later the creation of local functions creates
      the local namespace

    - Local namespace
      Creation on local function create local namespace
2. LEGB Rule
3. Closures
